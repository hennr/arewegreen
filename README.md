Out-of-the-box dashboard

## Get started

areWeGreen is not yet finished. Here is the plan though:

To run areWeGreen you simply need to fetch a release and add the executable to your autostarted programs.
areWeGreen will create a configuration folder in the home directory of the current user then.
Also it will start a browser which will open the dashboard in a maximized window for you.
